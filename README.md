# How it works

You only clone the repository in your favorite IDE.

# Getting started

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation) installed globally. We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from [Here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install), then run `yarn install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Next step is install packages with `npm i`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` or nun `ng serve --o` and browser open the web automaticly. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Building the project

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
